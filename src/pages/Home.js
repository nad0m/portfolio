            Colors play a vital role in making a web page usable or not. In CSS, we can control the foreground and background color of an element with the color and background properties. When I learned CSS back in the years, there wasnâ€™t a straightforward guide or way to learn how to use colors in CSS.

            I decided to write about colors and how to use them in CSS. In this article, I will explain color types, specific keywords, and when to use which along with use-cases and examples. Disclaimer: this is not an article about color theory.

}

export default Home
